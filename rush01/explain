Overview
This program is designed to solve the 4x4 skyscraper puzzle. The puzzle involves 
placing skyscrapers of heights 1 through 4 in a grid such that:
Each row and column contains exactly one skyscraper of each height (1 to 4).
Each row and column also has a given clue, indicating how many skyscrapers are 
visible when viewed from that direction.

Code Breakdown
Input Parsing: The code reads the input string and correctly parses the clues for 
the four visible values from top, bottom, left, and right for the grid.

Grid Setup: The code initializes a 4x4 grid and tries placing numbers from 1 to 4 while ensuring each number 
appears only once per row and column.

Backtracking: The program uses a backtracking approach to fill in the grid, trying each number 
and verifying its validity at each step. It ensures that the grid satisfies the constraints at each stage.

Visibility Check: The check_clues function checks whether the grid configuration satisfies 
the visibility constraints from all four directions (top, bottom, left, right).

Output: The solution is printed in the specified format, with each number separated by a space, 
and the program outputs "Error" if no solution is found.

2. Main Program (main.c)
int	main(int argc, char **argv)
{
	int clues[16];  // Array to store the 16 clues (4 for each row/column)
	int grid[4][4]; // 4x4 grid for the puzzle solution

	// Check for valid input (must be one argument, and parse the clues correctly)
	if (argc != 2 || !parse_clues(argv[1], clues)) {
		write(1, "Error\n", 6);
		return (1);
	}

	// Initialize the grid (all cells start as 0)
	init_grid(grid);

	// Attempt to solve the puzzle using backtracking
	if (solve(grid, clues, 0, 0))
		print_grid(grid);  // If solved, print the grid
	else
		write(1, "Error\n", 6);  // If not solved, print "Error"
	return (0);
}
Input Parsing: It checks if the user provided exactly one argument. 
The clues (a string of 16 digits) are passed to parse_clues() to be converted into an array.
Grid Initialization: init_grid() initializes a 4x4 grid with zeros (empty cells).
Solving the Puzzle: The solve() function is called to attempt solving the puzzle using a backtracking algorithm. 
If the puzzle is solved, it calls print_grid() to display the result.
Error Handling: If the puzzle can't be solved or if the input is invalid, it prints "Error\n".

3. Grid Initialization (init_grid)
void	init_grid(int grid[4][4])
{
	for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
		for (int j = 0; j < 4; j++)
			grid[i][j] = 0;  // Fill the grid with zeros (empty)
}
This function initializes the grid as a 4x4 grid filled with zeros (0). 
This is essentially setting up an empty puzzle board.
grid[4][4]: A 2D array where each element represents a cell in the puzzle.

4. Grid Printing (print_grid)
void	print_grid(int grid[4][4])
{
	for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) 
	{
    	for (int j = 0; j < 4; j++) 
	    {
        	char c = grid[i][j] + '0'; // Convert the integer to its char representation
			write(1, &c, 1);  // Print the number as a character
			if (j < 3)
				write(1, " ", 1);  // Print a space between numbers
		}
		write(1, "\n", 1);  // Newline at the end of each row
	}
}
This function prints the 4x4 grid in a readable format.
Each integer in the grid is converted to its character equivalent and printed, followed by a space 
(except for the last element in each row).
A newline (\n) is printed after each row to separate them.

5. Parsing Clues (parse_clues)
int	parse_clues(char *str, int *clues)
{
	int i = 0;
	while (*str) {
		if (*str >= '1' && *str <= '4') // Ensure each character is between '1' and '4'
			clues[i++] = *str - '0';  // Convert character to integer and store in clues array
		else if (*str != ' ')  // If there's a non-digit or non-space, return error
			return (0);
		str++;
	}
	return (i == 16);  // Ensure we have exactly 16 clues
}
Clue Parsing: This function takes a string (e.g., "4 3 2 1 ...") and parses it into the clues array. 
It converts each character into an integer between 1 and 4 and stores it in the clues array.
It ensures the string is valid by checking each character: if it's a digit between '1' and '4' or a space. 
If the string is not valid, it returns 0. The function returns 1 if exactly 16 clues are successfully parsed.

6. Validation (is_valid)
int	is_valid(int grid[4][4], int row, int col, int num)
{
	for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
		if (grid[row][i] == num || grid[i][col] == num)  // Check if the number already exists in the row or column
			return (0);  // Invalid if the number is found
	}
	return (1);  // Valid if no conflicts are found
}
This function checks if placing the number num at the position (row, col) in the grid is valid.
It checks if the number already exists in the same row or column. If it does, the placement is invalid, and the function returns 0. 
If no conflicts are found, it returns 1 (valid).

7. Solving the Puzzle (solve)
int	solve(int grid[4][4], int *clues, int row, int col)
{
	if (row == 4)  // Base case: if all rows are filled, check if the solution is correct
		return (check_clues(grid, clues));

	for (int num = 1; num <= 4; num++) {  // Try all possible numbers (1 to 4)
		if (is_valid(grid, row, col, num)) {  // Check if the number is valid
			grid[row][col] = num;  // Place the number in the grid
			if (col == 3) {  // If we've reached the end of a row
				if (solve(grid, clues, row + 1, 0))  // Move to the next row
					return (1);
			}
			else {  // Otherwise, move to the next column in the same row
				if (solve(grid, clues, row, col + 1))
					return (1);
			}
			grid[row][col] = 0;  // Backtrack if the current number doesn't lead to a solution
		}
	}
	return (0);  // Return 0 if no solution is found
}
Backtracking Solver: The solve function uses backtracking to attempt to fill the grid. 
It starts from the top-left and tries placing each number (1-4) in the current empty spot.
If placing a number is valid (using the is_valid function), it moves to the next column. If the column reaches the end of the row, 
it moves to the next row.
If a valid configuration is found, it recursively attempts to fill the rest of the grid. If an invalid configuration is found later, 
it backtracks by resetting the current spot and trying the next number.

8. Clue Checking (check_clues)
int	check_clues(int grid[4][4], int *clues);
The check_clues function checks if the current configuration of the grid satisfies the clues provided. 
This function is not fully implemented in the code you provided, 
but it would involve checking the number of visible boxes from each direction 
(left-right for rows, top-bottom for columns) and comparing it to the given clues.

Conclusion
This program reads a set of clues, parses them, initializes a 4x4 grid, and attempts to solve the skyscraper puzzle using backtracking. 
If a valid solution is found, the grid is printed; otherwise, it prints "Error\n".

The key steps include:
Parsing the clues: Extracting the 16 clues from the input.
Backtracking: Trying different numbers in each cell and checking for validity.
Clue validation: Ensuring that the puzzle solution satisfies all the clues.
I hope this step-by-step breakdown clarifies how the code works! Let me know if you need further details.4x4 grid, 
and attempts to solve the skyscraper puzzle using backtracking. If a valid solution is found, the grid is printed; 
otherwise, it prints "Error\n".

The input string is composed of 16 integers, which represent the clues for the puzzle. 
The first 4 numbers are the top views for the columns, the next 4 are the bottom views for the columns, 
the next 4 are the left views for the rows, and the last 4 are the right views for the rows.

For the input:

arduino
Copy
Edit
"4 3 2 1 1 2 2 2 4 3 2 1 1 2 2 2"
Column top views (from left to right): 4 3 2 1

Column bottom views (from left to right): 1 2 2 2

Row left views (from top to bottom): 4 3 2 1

Row right views (from top to bottom): 1 2 2 2

Output Format:
The output is a 4x4 grid that satisfies the following constraints:

Each row and column should contain the numbers 1 through 4 exactly once.

The numbers represent the heights of the boxes in each cell.

The number of visible boxes from each viewpoint should match the given clue for that row or column.

For example:

ruby
Copy
Edit
1 2 3 4$
2 3 4 1$
3 4 1 2$
4 1 2 3$
This output means:

From the left of each row, 
you should see 4, 3, 2, and 1 boxes respectively (for rows 1 to 4).

From the right of each row, 
you should see 1, 2, 2, and 2 boxes respectively.

From the top of each column, 
you should see 4, 3, 2, and 1 boxes respectively.

From the bottom of each column, 
you should see 1, 2, 2, and 2 boxes respectively.

How the Program Works:
The program needs to solve 
a 4x4 grid puzzle by placing the numbers 1 to 4 in such a way that:

The grid satisfies the constraints on visible boxes from each viewpoint.

The program outputs the first valid solution it finds.

The process involves:

Backtracking: Trying different placements of numbers and checking 
if the current placement satisfies 
the visibility rules.

Checking visibility: For each possible placement, the program will check whether the current 
placement matches the given visibility constraints (top/bottom/left/right).
